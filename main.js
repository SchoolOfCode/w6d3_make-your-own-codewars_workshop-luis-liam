    - Write a function which converts a string in camelCase to a string in kebab-case.
    - If the input is NOT a string OR the input IS a string which contains numbers, return "Input is not a camel case string, try again..."

    Examples:
        "CamelCase" should return "camel-case",
        "iDontKnowWhatImDoing" should return "i-dont-know-what-im-doing",
        "abc123" should return "Input is not a camel case string, try again...",
        12345 should return "Input is not a camel case string, try again...",
        false should return "Input is not a camel case string, try again..."
